First turn off the bike to remove the battery.<br/>2. Locate the brake pads. The brake pads are located inside the brake caliper on each wheel (see photos for reference)<br/>3. Remove the brake caliper first. Use a hex key to remove the two brake caliper bolts from the bike frame(Warning: Be careful not to lose or misplace the washers inside of the brake caliper bolts.)<br/>4. Carefully straighten the retention pin using needle-nose pliers to remove the brake caliper by pushing it upwards. <br/>5. Remove the old brake pads. The pin and the old brakes can be removed by pressing the leaf spring.<br/><br/>Step 2: Brake Pad Installation<br/>1. Install the new brake pads into the brake caliper. Assemble the brake pads in the same configuration as the old pads. The friction material should be facing each other. Make sure the top hole of each pad is aligned with the retention pinhole. Slide the new brakes into the caliper to complete installation.<br/>2. Replace the brake retention pin. Make sure the brake caliper is secure by carefully bending the retention pin to a 90°angle with needle-nose pliers.<br/>3. Reinstall the caliper.  Position the caliper so that the mounting holes on the frame align with the mounting points on the caliper. Using a hex key, insert the bolts and evenly tighten both bolts. <br/>4.

An improperly seated wheel can cause the brake disc to rub against the brake pads and generate noise.<br/>• Checking that the brake disc is straight and in good condition. Damaged or dirty brake discs can result in reduced brake performance or noise.<br/>• Centering the brake caliper by adjusting the positioning so the inner pad, a stationary component of the brake caliper, is close and parallel to the brake discs. A brake pad or brake caliper that is not properly positioned can lead to reduced brake performance or noise.<br/>• Adjusting the brake cable tension and checking the brake lever. These final adjustments will help ensure the brakes were adjusted correctly.</p>",
